# shlwapi.h 

This repository contains my version of the C include file `shlwapi.h` for MSYS2/MinGW and some unit test code.

The definitive documentation for the SHWAPI library is [shlwapi.h header](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shlwapi/).

The unit tests here were adapted from the unit tests for [The Wine Project](https://www.winehq.org/) implementation of SHLWAPI.
